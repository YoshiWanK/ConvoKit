These have been a disturbing element due to their volatility. The agreement provides that the BIS [Bank for International Settlements] will finance the Bank of England to the extent that these balances are reduced, except by bond funding and to the extent that the British reserves simultaneously go down. The details are to be worked out. If the BIS cannot fully carry through that financing, it has a fallback with respect to the participating central banks. Now, the Bank of England is committed to use its best efforts to reduce official sterling balances to working balances. First, by a funding operation offering some of the major holders of official balances 5- to 10- year bonds, 75 percent of which, at a maximum, would be in dollars, the rest in nondollar and nonsterling currencies. Second, whatever is left of the total balances after this operation, [the goal would be] to bring that down to the level of working balances. The detail of that is not described, but it could consist of various administrative measures. Broadly speaking, we're talking about something like PS2 billion sterling, or $3.4 billion [equivalent]; maybe half a billion pounds of that could be funded. Maybe something like PS1 billion might remain as working balances, and the other half billion would have to worked off over time. This is to be done in cooperation with and under the supervision of the Managing Director of the IMF [International Monetary Fund]. The Managing Director of the IMF will confer with the U.K. jointly with the governors of the participating central banks to observe the progress made. Should it turn out that progress is not satisfactory during the two years during which the stand-by agreement is in effect, or if the U.K. should become ineligible to draw under the IMF's stand-by during these two years, then the facility can be suspended. In that case, also, the amounts already drawn will be required to be repaid within 120 days unless the agreement is reconstituted. These are the principle parts of the agreement. Do you want me to go into the Treasury side of this?\", 'sentences': [{'lemmas': 'the purpose of the agreement -- which exist in principle , and its main component remain to be finalize in a few detail -- be to reduce official sterling balance .', 'ners': 'o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o', 'pos_tags': 'dt nn in dt nn : wdt vbz in nn , cc prp$ jj nns vbp to vb vbn in dt jj nns : vbz to vb jj nn nns .', 'words': 'the purpose of the agreement -- which exists in principle , and its main components remain to be finalized in a few details -- is to reduce official sterling balances .'}, {'lemmas': 'these have be a disturbing element due to they volatility .', 'ners': 'o o o o o o o o o o o', 'pos_tags': 'dt vbp vbn dt jj nn jj to prp$ nn .', 'words': 'these have been a disturbing element due to their volatility .'}, {'lemmas': 'the agreement provide that the bi -lsb- bank for international settlements -rsb- will finance the bank of england to the extent that these balance be reduce , except by bond funding and to the extent that the british reserve simultaneously go down .', 'ners': 'o o o o o o o organization organization organization organization o o o o organization organization organization o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o misc o o o o o', 'pos_tags': 'dt nn vbz in dt nn -lrb- nnp in nnp nnp -rrb- md vb dt nnp in nnp to dt nn in dt nns vbp vbn , in in nn nn cc to dt nn in dt jj nns rb vbp rb .', 'words': 'the agreement provides that the bis -lsb- bank for international settlements -rsb- will finance the bank of england to the extent that these balances are reduced , except by bond funding and to the extent that the british reserves simultaneously go down .'}, {'lemmas': 'the detail be to be work out .', 'ners': 'o o o o o o o o', 'pos_tags': 'dt nns vbp to vb vbn rp .', 'words': 'the details are to be worked out .'}, {'lemmas': 'if the bis can not fully carry through that financing , it have a fallback with respect to the participate central bank .', 'ners': 'o o organization o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o', 'pos_tags': 'in dt nnp md rb rb vb in dt nn , prp vbz dt nn in nn to dt vbg jj nns .', 'words': 'if the bis can not fully carry through that financing , it has a fallback with respect to the participating central banks .'}, {'lemmas': 'now , the bank of england be commit to use its best effort to reduce official sterling balance to work balance .', 'ners': 'date o o organization organization organization o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o', 'pos_tags': 'rb , dt nnp in nnp vbz vbn to vb prp$ jjs nns to vb jj nn nns to vbg nns .', 'words': 'now , the bank of england is committed to use its best efforts to reduce official sterling balances to working balances .'}, {'lemmas': 'first , by a funding operation offer some of the major holder of official balance 5 - to 10 - year bond , 75 percent of which , at a maximum , would be in dollar , the rest in nondollar and nonsterling currency .', 'ners': 'ordinal o o o o o o o o o o o o o o number o o duration duration duration o o percent percent o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o', 'pos_tags': 'rb , in dt nn nn vbg dt in dt jj nns in jj nns ls : to cd : nn nns , cd nn in wdt , in dt nn , md vb in nns , dt nn in nn cc jj nns .', 'words': 'first , by a funding operation offering some of the major holders of official balances 5 - to 10 - year bonds , 75 percent of which , at a maximum , would be in dollars , the rest in nondollar and nonsterling currencies .'}, {'lemmas': 'second , whatever be leave of the total balance after this operation , -lsb- the goal would be -rsb- to bring that down to the level of work balance .', 'ners': 'ordinal o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o', 'pos_tags': 'rb , wdt vbz vbn in dt jj nns in dt nn , -lrb- dt nn md vb -rrb- to vb dt rb to dt nn in vbg nns .', 'words': 'second , whatever is left of the total balances after this operation , -lsb- the goal would be -rsb- to bring that down to the level of working balances .'}, {'lemmas': 'the detail of that be not describe , but it could consist of various administrative measure .', 'ners': 'o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o', 'pos_tags': 'dt nn in dt vbz rb vbn , cc prp md vb in jj jj nns .', 'words': 'the detail of that is not described , but it could consist of various administrative measures .'}, {'lemmas': 'broadly speak , we be talk about something like ps2 billion sterling , or $ 3.4 billion -lsb- equivalent -rsb- ;

And therefore, the chances are that we at no point over the next two years will have to put up one penny. But, of course, it's a contingent liability, and we must be entirely clear on that. But the present expectation is that the BIS will be able to meet whatever credit needs Britain may have under this agreement, and the BIS will not find it necessary to call on us or on the other central banks that are parties to this undertaking.

Now I don't know if members of the Committee have received a document prepared by Mr. Morton of our staff, which gives the history of our warehousing of foreign currencies in the U.S. Treasury. It was first authorized by this Committee in November 1963, and in September 1968, the warehousing authorization was fixed at $1 billion for, I believe, a period of up to one year. The present requested or recommended authorization is larger, up to $1-1/2 billion. However, the period on the average is shorter, half of it for a period of six months, and half for a period of 12 months. Now, in discussion of this suggestion with Governor Lilly at the luncheon table, Governor Lilly raised the question about the period of agreement. And then, in the course of the discussion, it became clear that this Committee reviews its foreign currency directive, among others, annually in March, I believe. Therefore, any year in March, if there is some question about this warehousing arrangement, its extension into the future, any modification of it--that would be the time [for this Committee] to take it up, and that could then be negotiated with the Treasury in accordance with the wishes of the Committee.

The issues to which I think attention should initially be addressed, Mr. Chairman, relate to the definition of \"agency\" as it\\'s set forth in the statute [and] the question, Does the law apply to the Federal Open Market Committee? In essence, the requirement of the law is that every agency as defined in title 5 of the United States Code, the Administrative Procedure Act, must, after a stated date--March 12 of the next year--conduct, with certain stated exemptions, all of its meetings in open session. The exemptions, I think, are to be considered only after a body has determined whether it meets the statutory definition of agency. Now, as the Committee knows, Mr. Chairman, [the FOMC] has for purposes of other statutes assumed historically the status of an agency. Thus, under the Administrative Procedure Act, the Federal Open Market Committee is an agency, and we have thus taken that position. Under the Freedom of Information Act, the FOMC is an agency. So the question would arise, Would it not thus be the same under the [Government in the] Sunshine Act? Well, if I may, the term \"agency\" means any agency, as defined in the statute that I\\'ve identified, headed by a collegial body composed of two or more individual members, a majority of whom are appointed to such position by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, and any subdivision thereof authorized to act on behalf of the agency. On the basis of a thorough study of this statute--of the legislative history, including the committee actions [and] committee reports from both the House and the Senate and [from] the conference committee that reported out this bill before its enactment into law, we have given a definitional judgment that the statute does not apply to the FOMC for the very simple reason that the definition of agency requires that the collegial members to whom reference is made be appointed to such position [by the President]. Now as the Committee is aware, this Committee is composed of the Board members and five Presidents of Reserve Banks. The members of the Board are appointed to the Board by the President with confirmation of the Senate. They are ex officio members of the FOMC. By that I mean they are members by statutory grant, not by direct appointment of the President. They are appointed to the Board and then statute makes members of the Board members of the FOMC. The issue of ex officio status was directly addressed by the sponsors of this bill, particularly Ms. Abzug, who was asked this question with respect to the National Security Council, the [Joint] Chiefs of Staff, and one or two other agencies. And after going through the same definition I\\'ve now discussed, she reached the decision, and stated as reported in the legislative history, that such members were not the collegial--appointed to such position--members called for in the statute, and thus such a group would not be an agency within the meaning of the statute. The question arises, Well, what about the phrase \"or subdivision of an agency, authorized to act on behalf of the agency?\" I think, immediately and clearly, the Federal Open Market Committee is not a subdivision or subsidiary of the Board. Obviously, the Committee is composed of its membership with its statutory functions directly in the language of section 12(a) of the statute. It is not a derivative of the [Board] by statute, although its membership is partly composed of members of the Board. That issue was discussed in the legislative history, and Ms. Abzug, again, who was the sponsor of the bill, made clear that the fact she referred to what is a happenstance of law, that membership is identically composed, does not fit the meaning of this term. And that therefore, such happenstance does not constitute a mandate of coverage by the statute. Mr. Chairman, the alternative, of course, is to assume this Committee had the question put to it [unintelligible] assume the status of a covered agency. I would raise [unintelligible] question as, not only to the desirability of such assumption, but of the ability of an administrative agency, as this Committee is for other purposes, and of the statute to assume coverage of a statute. One of the reasons I say this is that there are provisions in this bill that affect venue, jurisdiction, the right of courts of review, the methodology of review, the impact of timing on the agency to respond to suit, and even the right to bring suit on the part of a party. I don\\'t know of the authority in a federal agency who has [unintelligible] question under an interpretation of the law to say as a matter of decisional act, let\\'s apply the law to us with all of its benefits and with all of its adverse consequence. For instance, normally, if this agency were sued without stint of [the] Sunshine [Act]--just a suit brought, for instance, for declaratory judgment--I think a court of law might properly ask, how much time would the agency have to respond? The answer would be 60 days. It\\'s an agency of the federal government, and under title 28 of the code, it has 60 days to respond. How many days did you take here? We took 28 because of this law. Therefore, you, by pulling the law over your shoulders, you\\'ve deprived your agency of roughly 32 days\\' time to answer. Who is your counsel? Well, the Department of Justice is our counsel. Did the Department concur that they were deprived of 32 days\\' time? No, they objected and said that we had 60 days. But since we assumed the status of an agency covered by this act, we were deprived of those 30 days. I raise this as an example of a jurisdictional \"pullover.\" I question the right of an agency, be it this Committee or any other government agency, to deprive courts of other jurisdiction it might have, including appeal and other derivative procedural rights that are either granted or forbidden by the statute. I bring this to your attention only in the decisional basis. It is my belief that there is good, strong, statutory language reference, as well as the legislative history, to support the position that this agency, as an agency, is not covered by Sunshine. I\\'ve given you an example of the trouble I would have with a voluntary assumption of that status. There are a number of practical reasons, that I won\\'t at this time take the Committee\\'s time to discuss, that I think argue strongly not to legally take the position that the statute covers this agency. Now I say the latter for the simple reason that, I must advise, there is legislative history that, [it] can be argued, supports the legal position that this Committee is covered by [the] Sunshine [Act]. When I say that, I mean there are exchanges on the floor of the House and on the floor of the Senate in the nature of colloquy. They are not contained in committee reports officially reported on the statute. They are colloquy exchanges in which one member of the House asks a series of questions, for instance of the sponsor of the bill, and in asking the question [will make] reference specifically [to] the FOMC. And Ms. Abzug, in replying, used the term \"the FOMC,\" saying the FOMC would have no trouble, it could close all of those meetings. I am sure that these exemptions would cover the FOMC. So I bring to your attention my judgment that these discussions mark an assumed coverage of the FOMC status. [The colloquy exchanges] then answered other questions that [were] relevant to the inquiry then being made. In fairness, that\\'s the reference I have to the fact that the legislative history does bear some suggestion of coverage, if you start with the assumed position that I have identified. On balance, I believe that the better position is that it is not covered and that there are good, salutary, functional reasons for following that position. And Mr. Chairman, these roughly are my comments on the background, and I\\'ll go any length further that you wish.', 'sentences': [{'lemmas': 'yes , mr. chairman .', 'ners': 'o o o person o',

'speaker': \"MR. O'CONNELL.\", 'speech_index': 114}, {'text': \"Thank you very much. I have unavoidably become involved in the study of this problem in extensive conversations concerning it. And I don't have a single reason to question anything Mr. O'Connell has stated. But I do think we have a congressional problem, one that I'm trying to test. I'm not using the word resolve, because I don't think the question is of a sort that can be resolved--but it can be tested, and it can serve as a guide to a rational decision by us. What is the congressional problem? Well, it so happens that there are some members of the Congress, and particularly staff members, who are following the Sunshine legislation--what is being done under it--very closely, and who are concerned about any decision that we may make concerning the FOMC. Now if the conclusion were reached, by this or that influential congressman concerned with this legislation, that we're engaged in the circumvention of law, or that we're following the law strictly but that the law contains a loophole, then this or that interested congressman might propose an amendment to the Sunshine Act. And if that amendment is on the floor, an amendment designed simply to encompass the FOMC in the course of debate--as things happen in the Congress, we stand a chance of losing the two exemptions that we won last year and which make it really possible, at least as I see it, for the Federal Reserve System to function. And therefore, I have begun a series of conversations with key members of the Congress. I saw Congressman Fascell, who is the author of this legislation, or if not quite that, the chief intellectual exponent of it, in the House of Representatives. He's friendly, and he has no desire as such to present an amendment. But I now have to see Senator Chiles, Senator Ribicoff, Congressman Brooks, and, on the Republican side of the House of Representatives, Mr. Horton. I don't anticipate any difficulty, except perhaps with Senator Chiles. Senator Chiles, I hope I'm being fair to him, was the author of this legislation on the Senate side. He felt very unhappy about the amendments that we achieved in the Congress last year. He felt very strongly about the legislation as it was passed by the Senate originally. He might be described, perhaps unfairly, as being the theologian on this issue. If I succeed in persuading him that without coming formally under the Sunshine legislation we are not only adhering in full to the principles of the legislation, but going beyond it--I'll explain that in a moment--if I succeed in that mission, which I've set for myself with Senator Chiles, then I think Tom's recommendation is clearly the right one. If I fail, I'm not sure of a conclusion, but that is where my problems begin in making a recommendation to this Committee, and I'm not at [that] point. Now, in this Committee we are living strictly, I think, within the spirit of the Sunshine legislation. The exemption under the Sunshine law, I think, would make it possible for us to close every meeting. The law as written requires that a verbatim transcript of every meeting be kept or that carefully prepared minutes be written out. Well, certainly our secretarial staff is discharging the latter function--preparation of minutes--in exemplary fashion. Not only that, but the law does not require publication of the minutes, and we do publish the minutes. Not only do we publish them, but we publish them as promptly as is technically feasible. That is, within a period of something like 30 days. Therefore, we not only are living within the spirit of the Sunshine law but going beyond it. Now if a little speech like that will warm Senator Chiles's heart, and it's a factual statement, then I believe that we need not fear an amendment to the Sunshine law being proposed in the Congress. And we can adopt Mr. O'Connell's recommendation very comfortably. But as I stated, if Senator Chiles feels that here is a loophole in the legislation that must be closed, that he is going to propose an amendment--that raises a difficult political problem for us, a problem I've already stated. Namely, once an amendment comes to the floor, other amendments might be added; we might lose one or the other or both of the exemptions that we won last year after a most arduous battle in which all of you participated. And who knows, other burdensome amendments might be added. There is an element of hazard there. That's all I can say on the subject as of today.\", 'sentences': [{'lemmas': 'thank you very much .', 'ners': 'o o o o o', 'pos_tags': 'vb prp rb rb .', 'words': 'thank you very much .'}, {'lemmas':

And so, even if that were, say, a point higher than what's projected, it would not be an extraordinary number. It could be a point higher if we get a little more capital spending, a little more inventory than suggested. But even with that, it seems to me that, as you reach the end of 1977, you wouldn't be talking about really high utilization rates, you wouldn't be talking about, well, an unemployment rate that would be down even to anyone's objectives. So I don't think there is that much difficulty if there should be some moderate overrun from staff projections in the actual results of the economy in the course of the year. There is another point, though, that I would like to bring to the Committee's attention. Some few of us have continued to watch the full employment surplus and deficit numbers, and I want to point out that the concept of potential GNP has been revised to reduce, I think, to a more realistic objective the rates of growth that can be expected in the real economy based on productivity and labor force growth. And also [it has been revised] to adjust for structural changes in the labor force so that the unemployment rate associated with full employment is no longer 4 [percent] on the nose but, as a matter of fact, for the year 1976, is 4.96 because of structural changes--almost 5 percent. And that, also, is a desirable change. But the result is that, even with the proposed fiscal program--which I would think is more apt to be altered in the direction of being more liberal than less liberal as it goes through Congress and as the new Administration considers it--with that program, there is, on these new figures, a rather high full employment deficit for 1977, calendar '77. Our staff estimate is [for a] $26.3 billion full employment deficit in that year. And related to potential GNP, on the new measure of GNP growth, this is the highest proportion of potential GNP in more than a decade with the exception of only one year, 1967. In 1967, the full employment deficit, on these new figures relative to potential GNP, was a bit higher than is now projected for '77. Well, it's a very considerable increase from calendar '76 to calendar '77, from a $12 billion full employment deficit to a $26 billion full employment deficit. That gives me pause and concern about financial market conditions as the year goes on because, although I never believed much in the idea of crowding-out on the basis of just the actual deficit figures, I noted long ago that if you look at the full employment deficit figures and you see a sharp shift toward deficit which is associated with tighter conditions and higher interest rates, it is going to be a problem as the year goes on. It also does contain the possibility, this kind of a full employment deficit--which I'm pretty sure will be the highest in the postwar period, although the figures were taken back only to 1964-- may have psychological effects on inflationary expectations in the economy.\", 'sentences': [{'lemmas': 'for the next four quarter .', 'ners': 'o duration duration duration duration o', 'pos_tags': 'in dt

In addition to the financial consequences, it also shows the greater limitations in the way of capital expenditures that we face once the economy is operating at a high level again and the problem, therefore, of getting an adequate amount of capital spending. Well, the other point I wanted to make is the stimulus that is being proposed to be put into the economy, not in fiscal '78 but in the following year. The program is divided in those two parts. The second part is more iffy than the first, but they seem to be of about equal size--$15 billion apiece.

I can see some very sharp run-ups in consumer spending right after a rebate, if that's the way the Congress goes. I can see as a possibility that there may be another--if there is such a thing--midcourse pause somewhere down the line, too.

I think members of the Committee know that the House Banking Committee will be holding a hearing on February 3 under the House Concurrent Resolution. I will be testifying on that subject on that day. And therefore, this Committee must today decide once again on our monetary objectives for the year ahead, that is, for the interval running from the fourth quarter of 1976 to the fourth quarter of 1977. Now, in setting these monetary targets for the year ahead, we need to consider apparent conditions of the economy. We\\'ve done that. We need to consider economic prospects for the year ahead and their dependence on the monetary policy that we lay down, and we\\'ve done that. We know less about monetary policy, on our overall judgment, than about economic prospects. And finally, we need to consider the degree to which, if any, our monetary policy should contribute to unwinding the inflation from which our economy has been suffering since the mid-1960s. Of these several considerations, the last, I believe, is peculiarly important for us at the Federal Reserve. I say this because no other branch of government, certainly not the executive, certainly not the Congress, has anything approaching an articulate policy for bringing down the rate of inflation. Now, if we at the Federal Reserve should fail to persevere in bringing down our monetary growth rates, which are far too high from the viewpoint of ever returning to price stability, there would be no chance whatever for reestablishing a foundation for economic stability in the future. Recognizing this basic principle, this Committee during the past 21 months has moved very gradually, but rather consistently, toward lower monetary growth rates. Our moves may have been much too gradual, but they at least have been in a salutary direction. In approaching the problem of setting monetary growth rates for the year ahead, I start with the basic thought that, if at all feasible, we should once again make a small move in the direction of monetary growth rates that are tolerably consistent with eventual restoration of a stable price level. Now, in my own mind, this basic thought is clouded by other considerations, namely, unemployment is still unduly high. We have a new Administration; the new Administration has proposed a fiscal plan for reducing unemployment, and any lowering of monetary growth rates at this time would, I\\'m quite sure, be very widely interpreted--and not only in the political arena--as an attempt on the part of the Federal Reserve to frustrate the efforts of a newly elected President and newly elected Congress to get our economy, to use a popular phrase, \"moving once again.\" I\\'ve tried--it obviously isn\\'t easy--to bring these two sets of thoughts into some sort of harmony. And accordingly, my recommendations to the Committee are as follows. First, that we leave the projected growth range for M1 as is--4-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent--for the coming year. Second, that we modify the growth ranges for M2 and M3--specifically, that the growth range of M2 be set at 7 to 10 percent instead of 7-1/2 to 10 percent, and the growth range of M3 be set at 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent instead of 9 to 11-1/2. The proposal to leave M1 unchanged has at least this advantage: You would avoid any charge that the Federal Reserve is indifferent to unemployment or, and this is more serious, it would avoid the charge that we are seeking to frustrate the efforts of the new Administration. The proposal to lower the lower limits of M2 and M3 by 1/2 percentage point has, I think, the following advantages. First, it recognizes the recent tendency of various banks and thrift institutions around the country to reduce the interest rates paid to savers, and this tendency may well result in a lower growth rate of M2 and M3 in the immediately succeeding months. Later on in the year, higher market rates of interest may well slow down the inflow of funds to thrift institutions. And finally, the slight lowering of the lower limit of M2 and M3 would once again provide some evidence that the Federal Reserve is sticking to its repeatedly stated objective of gradually bringing down the monetary growth rates in the interest of restoring--not immediately, but over a period years--general price stability. Now, I realize that the lowering of the lower limit of M2 and M3 might evoke some criticism. But on this point I would say the following. First, no matter what we do, there will be some criticism, and this is an inevitable accompaniment of central bank action. Secondly, I would say that, as we all know, far less attention is paid by the general public, by the Congress, even by economists, to M2 or M3 than to M1. M1 is still the magnitude that is widely followed and respected. And I would say, finally, that even after lowering the lower limit of M2 and M3, the midpoint of the range for M2 and the midpoint of the range for M3 would still be precisely what it was six months ago. Therefore, no lowering from where it was six months ago, and this would be duly noted in our statement to the Congress. These are my best thoughts on a very difficult subject. Let us now have a general discussion and try to determine where we should come out. Who would like to speak first?

Anyhow, I found it helpful to go back and look at '75, and I'd like to review that briefly. What happened was that the funds rate moved up somewhat to help keep the aggregates under control in the spring of that year. The aggregates, as you may remember, considerably exceeded the targets for a time: M1, for example, grew at an annual rate of 11 percent in one month, and 18 percent in another month--two successive months. The Committee did not change the long-term targets to accommodate those overshoots. And so, in effect, the Committee permitted some increase in rates, it permitted some overshoots in the aggregates temporarily, and it held the long-term target. I think this is a good model to follow because it does have the advantage of supporting the fiscal action, of being careful to hold any increase in interest rates to moderate amounts--to only those amounts it would be necessary to prevent the aggregates from getting completely out of hand.

And in fact, if adjusted for earlier conditions, [it is] perhaps as much as a couple of percentage points below where it otherwise would have been if these changes in financial technology had not come about. That's one point I'd like to get laid on the table as a background for my own personal views as to what ranges we ought to adopt. And the second key consideration in my thinking was one that Governor Jackson has just alluded to, and that is, for some time now, we have had inconsistent ranges, I'm afraid, for M1 versus M2 and M3. The big overshoot we've seen in M2 and M3, we all know about, and I'm concerned that that will continue to go on; and that really, to be consistent with our M1 growth range, we have needed--for some time now--a higher range of growth for both M2 and M3. The third consideration in my thinking is that, for some time, my staff has been calling my attention, and increasingly so in the very recent past, to the fact that, as they looked at the historical record, M2 has now emerged as a superior measure of monetary influence on the economy since about mid-'74, if you go back and make all the tests--from, say, 1960 to '74. The forecast of GNP through the third quarter of last year, using both M1 and M2--the M2 forecast is now showing a lower error than M1. In short, I hope that, if you feel you can help educate both the Congress and the public about that fact, [then] we perhaps ourselves [will pay] even more attention to M2 than we have. Perhaps weighing it even more heavily than the 50 percent that we've been giving it. Before I came in and heard your persuasive remarks--and I'm impressed by all of the caveats that you've mentioned, about reaction to the Administration's new fiscal package to stimulate employment and a fear that we may be frustrating their objectives--I prepared a different set of numbers that I think might get around the problems which you mentioned. And that would be first of all to reduce the M1 growth range to 4 to 6 percent, based on another of your good statements about how financial technology is changing. And if you agree with the analysis that I've just gone through, to stress even more the importance that we now attach to M2--to make those growth ranges consistent--to up the growth range of M2 to 8 to 10 percent, and the M3, 9 to 12. So if we did all those things, we would be, on the one hand, seeming to reduce the M1 range--not seeming to, we would be--by half a point in both the upper and lower boundaries. But assuming a satisfactory explanation, at which you are very adept, of why we're doing this--in view of the change in financial technology and the growing importance of time and savings deposits--we would be on the record as increasing by half a point the lower range of M2--that is going from the present [range of] 7-1/2 to 10, [up] to 8 to 10. And with regard to M3, increasing by half a point the upper range, going from the present [range of] 9 to 11-1/2, up to 9 to 12. I'm equally concerned about the danger of inflation that's been discussed at length around here this morning. And I'm quite concerned that if we in this year ahead were to experience the same sort of large overshoot on M2 and M3 that we had in 1976, we might well be setting the stage for significant inflationary pressures by 1978. Well, for that rather complex set of reasons, I would therefore suggest a possible alternative for the three ranges that I just mentioned.\", 'sentences': [{'lemmas': 'mr. chairman , in some of you

With regard to M1, I\\'m a little surprised to hear President Balles suggest a reduction in the range, when earlier he commented that the implied velocity increase was extraordinarily large [on the order] of the 5-1/2 percent--that is where we were--in the projection. And I want to comment on that because I think that\\'s true. I believe that a 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 M1 range [is appropriate], given what I think are fairly optimistic views on inflation by the staff and a real growth rate which--it\\'s all right, but just--is at the lower end of a range that people would seek, I think, in the abstract, for 1977. It\\'s a tight objective, 4-1/2 to 6-1/2. I\\'m not at all sure that there won\\'t be people who will say that, \"Well, in view of the fiscal program and the needs of the economy, the Committee should have increased its M1 ranges.\" But I think I wouldn\\'t want to increase them, certainly not at this point, anyhow. I just would be afraid to make a further reduction, John, because of the implied velocity rise, even allowing for Steve\\'s 1 percentage point for shifting definition. You still have a large velocity rise--if I understood you right, you said 5.8 percent for the year, and if you take that point off, that would make it 4.8, and that\\'s still above the usual experience. Also, although I agree with what the Chairman said about the poor predictive results of the St. Louis model, I think the St. Louis model must have said about the same thing, given President Roos\\'s statement that we can\\'t make that real growth [projection] with the money supply range we have. Therefore, I am a little uncomfortable with 4-1/2 to 6-1/2--I think that the needs of the economy might be for more rather than less--but I would support the 4-1/2 to 6-1/2. Now M2 and M3--I think we need to recognize that what we\\'re doing essentially is projecting interest rates. Given the M1 growth rate and the performance of the economy, M2 and M3 will be largely a function of interest rates. Governor Jackson is quite right that the upper ends of the present ranges for M2 and M3 imply a considerable increase in interest rates. Because throughout 1976, we produced numbers a good deal higher for M2 and M3; and in the fourth quarter of 1976, we\\'ve produced much higher figures for M2 and M3 given the interest rates we had at that time. I\\'m inclined to think there will be some increase in interest rates, but I can\\'t support President Black\\'s suggestion that we reduce the upper end of that range, since I think it\\'s already a tight squeeze. It implies that we anticipate a considerable increase in interest rates as the year goes on to get down within the present ceiling on M2 and M3. I would, however, be prepared to support a lower limit of the range, and the reason I would is that we\\'ve been so miserable in our interest rate projections that, in fact, there could be a lot more interest rate rise than we expect as the year goes on, which would tend to produce low-end numbers for M2 and M3. And I doubt that, on those grounds alone, the Committee would want to loosen up on policy. That is, [if we get], let\\'s say, a very high federal deficit or a shift--as I said before--in the full employment deficit number to a much higher number, you [will get] considerable upward pressure on rates, and those savings inflows [will start] to recede significantly. I doubt that we would want, on those grounds alone, to pump a lot more money into the economy. In fact, I think we\\'d probably be inclined to go the other way. And therefore, I think it\\'s consistent to have a lower low end, Bob, on M2 and M3, rather than to reduce the high end, even though historically you\\'re quite right that those numbers are a little bit on the high side.', 'sentences': [{'lemmas': 'well , mr. chairman , i believe i would support the range you propose , recognize in each case that they be pretty tight .', 'ners': 'o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o', 'pos_tags': 'rb , nnp nnp , prp vbp prp md vb dt nns prp vbd , vbg in dt nn in prp vbp rb rb .', 'words': \"well , mr. chairman , i believe i would support the ranges you proposed , recognizing in each case that they 're pretty tight .\"}, {'lemmas': 'with regard to m1 , i be a little surprised to hear president balles suggest a reduction in the range , when earlier he comment that the imply velocity increase be extraordinarily large -lsb- on the order -rsb- of the 5-1/2 percent -- that be where we be -- in the projection .', 'ners': 'o o o o o o o o o o o o o person o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o percent percent o o o o o o o o o o o', 'pos_tags': 'in nn to nn , prp vbp dt jj jj to vb nnp nnp vbp dt nn in dt nn , wrb jjr prp vbd in dt vbn nn nn vbd rb jj -lrb- in dt nn -rrb- in dt cd nn : dt vbz wrb prp vbd : in dt nn .', 'words': \"with regard to m1 , i 'm a little surprised to hear president balles suggest a reduction in the range , when earlier he commented that the implied velocity increase was extraordinarily large -lsb- on the order -rsb- of the 5-1/2 percent -- that is where we were -- in the projection .\"}, {'lemmas': 'and i want to comment on that because i think that be true .', 'ners': 'o o o o o o o o o o o o o o', 'pos_tags': 'cc prp vbp to vb in dt in prp vbp dt vbz jj .', 'words': \"and i want to comment on that because i think that 's true .\"}, {'lemmas': 'i believe that a 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 m1 range -lsb- be appropriate -rsb- , give what i think be fairly optimistic view on inflation by the staff and a real growth rate which -- it be all right , but just -- be at the lower end of a range that people would seek , i think , in the abstract , for 1977 .', 'ners': 'o o o o number o number o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o date o', 'pos_tags': 'prp vbp in dt cd to cd nn nn -lrb- vbz jj -rrb- , vbn wp prp vbp vbp rb jj nns in nn in dt nn cc dt jj nn nn wdt : prp vbz rb rb , cc rb : vbz in dt jjr nn in dt nn in nns md vb , prp vbp , in dt jj , in cd .', 'words': \"i believe that a 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 m1 range -lsb- is appropriate -rsb- , given what i think are fairly optimistic views on inflation by the staff and a real growth rate which -- it 's all right , but just -- is at the lower end of a range that people would seek , i think , in the abstract , for 1977 .\"}, {'lemmas': 'it be a tight objective , 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 .', 'ners': 'o o o o o o number o number o', 'pos_tags': 'prp vbz dt jj nn , cd to cd .', 'words': \"it 's a tight objective , 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 .\"}, {'lemmas': \"i be not at all sure that there will not be people who will say that , `` well , in view of the fiscal program and the need of the economy , the committee should have increase its m1 range .

If we were to continue with the same ranges for M2 and M3, we would be doing nothing to correct for that overshoot. In other words, we would be allowing base drift to proceed. Now this is a convenient way of dealing with a past event, but it does not reflect the intentions that we had three months ago when we set this target. If, on the other hand, we bring down the range for M2 and M3, we would be making a correction of this overshoot, and I think that should carry some weight. Now, as to whether to reduce the upper or the lower end and whether these reductions should involve a change in the midpoint with respect to six months ago, is a more complex matter. There is some logic in bringing down the upper end, precisely because of the overshoot element. On the other hand, we've learned, I think, from the experience of past hearings, that Congress is more sensitive to the upper than the lower ends. Now let me comment for a moment on M2 and M3. I don't feel like giving much weight to M2 and M3 in the short run. In the long run, M2 has turned out to have been remarkably stable--over the last 15 years. I can only think at the present time that this is the result of two conflicting trends. The M1 component has all the instability that M1 has, and the time and savings deposit component has instabilities which we are familiar with, namely the intermediation process that occurs because market interest rates are low. So, stability here is, I think, [a] balance [of] conflicting forces, either of which could change, and for that reason M2 in the short-run does not impress me as a very valuable guide. I think the logic of the situation is that M2 will tend to move more slowly as interest rates go up, and in that sense, my concerns about base drift will be allayed. Also, the inconsistency that has been observed on the M1, M2, [and] M3 targets--the trends are just not in line with the way our ranges are set up. That, too, I think is likely to come more into line [if], over the years, interest rates go up. One last concern--the targets ought to be flexible. We want to be able to change our minds. The only consistent action we have taken is to lower them over time. This, too, is an element where flexibility or inflexibility can play a role. I agree with you, Mr. Chairman--there is never a good time. I suspect that now is perhaps a better time than three months from now to do it. I would like to caution us that we may run out of half percents, which [unintelligible] to reduce over time as we go, if we operate on the fringes as we have to, if we do that on a quarterly basis.

The arguments that I devised in my mind went something like this for a standstill: We do have adequate range [from] where we stand today to probably come within that. We certainly exceeded the M2, M3 this past year; I believe we came within the targets for M1. I don\\'t believe it is absolutely necessary for us to move every time, and perhaps when we see something very strong in the way of a move, it might be worthwhile to knock a full percentage point off instead of a half percentage point, and maybe cut your years to 5 instead of 10. But the lower growth rates, I think, can be reached within our current stance. Certainly if we\\'re looking at a 5 percent inflation, we\\'re going to have to accommodate some of that in our aggregates. But I look at the primary function of these annual rates, [and] as I see them, [there are] basically two. First, the public perception of what we\\'re doing and the congressional oversight position. And second, some very broad Committee guidance--I would emphasize very broad--because I don\\'t hear many Committee members, perhaps excluding President Balles, who keep reminding us that our short-run [targets] ought to be somewhat consistent with our long-run targets. And consequently, while we get some very broad guidance out of [the annual rates], our performance really hasn\\'t been tied very well to the long-range targets. I think the possibilities over the coming year are interesting--almost a possibility of a reversal of 1976--in that we might get greater M1 growth and lower M2, M3 growth, especially if we really believe that this economy is going to move up strongly and interest rates advance with it. To lower the targets comes down to a point, really, of the degree of harassment you want to take at your hearing, because I think you will get harassed by a Congress that says, \"Well, you are trying to frustrate us, and you\\'re not going to provide the funds necessary to make our fiscal policy work.\" Now that doesn\\'t bother me, because I\\'m not on the stand now. It may bother you considerably before your hearing\\'s over. But assuming you can get away with this without too much harassment, and I believe you can because of the particular points you picked, I\\'m perfectly willing to [reduce] the [lower end of the] range [for M2] to 7 and [for M3 to] 8-1/2. I would like to point out to the Committee that we do have a different spread in these three aggregates. M1 at 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 is a 2-point spread, and I have heard some around this table [who say] that it ought to be a single-point number and others who want a 3- or 4-point spread, including those who

And I want to get about the business of this overshoot. We have had half again as much overshoot as we have range in M1, and almost in M2, and almost in M3. So I think it's wise for us to lower the bottom, reducing the midpoint by 25 basis points. Because, really, as Governor Jackson says, what we've got to do is to forget about putting these two aggregates somewhat closer to our targets. Quite a bit over on both of them. They aren't going to change and become less of a key in the economy. The two--the velocity of money and the liquidity quotient of the economy--they are going to become more liquid, they are going to become more volatile. At least they're going to move more rapidly. M1 loses status in my mind. M2 and M3 are inevitably going to be more interconnected with the current state of transactions balances in the economy. So I'm perfectly happy widening the range a little bit, lowering the lower limit. I think that what we will be concerned with in the short range is our interest in the overshoots that we have had in the last year.

There's quite a lot of slack to be taken up if there was a real mortgage demand. But more generally, you can't help but sit here and be struck by the degree of consensus around the table, which means that there is very little to add. The differences are very narrow. Certainly, in approaching this problem, I've been impressed by some points that have been made repeatedly, that these targets are so high relative to our ultimate objectives, and we've got to work them down. They're also high relative to historical experience, including '72 and '73, when the Federal Reserve had a lot of criticism for stimulating inflation. And both those factors are fundamental to my approach. It's a little tricky to work it in with the present economic outlook and the question of whether we're consistent with the fiscal strategy of the Administration. As I view the outlook, I feel relatively comfortable, but I still do think there is a major problem in the investment area, which probably won't materialize in 1977 in terms of capacity restraints, but well could in 1978. And I don't see us making very much progress in that direction. And the possibility of greater congestion in financial markets, which was referred to this morning, on the surface at least, doesn't help. Take that all together and, in a kind of theoretical way, you could say what the doctor orders here is a tight-fiscal-policy, easy-monetary-policy kind of approach. But there is an overwhelming argument against that. We ain't got the tight-fiscal-policy approach. That's quite evident. So you have to work within that framework. And I think expectational factors here are very important in terms of that potential congestion in the market as related to the prospects for inflation. So I think it's very important that we do maintain a posture of not releasing the bands on inflation, and that may--through the expectational route--help avoid late, excessive congestion in financial markets and avoid inflational tendencies that we're all worried about. So I can rationalize, for my satisfaction at least, reversing the presumption of tight fiscal policy and easy monetary policy through that expectational route. My feeling coming here was that I'd be perfectly happy to see some gesture, not very substantive, toward reducing the targets. But I was certainly prepared to support no change, in recognition of the enormously difficult problem of explanation at this particular juncture. If we were going to make a change for more or less technical reasons, I was a little more on the Balles side in thinking that maybe at least the lower limit of M1 ought to be reduced--this consistency point that other people have referred to. But I think you can also argue that M2 and M3 have been moving at an exceptionally high rate with a change in the environment of the financial markets. And particularly without raising the upper limit, as you have suggested. This can be rationalized over a period of time. So I'm quite happy to go along with your suggestion, recognizing that you volunteered to take on the burden of explaining, which I think is crucial here, and I think you have the equipment, as you demonstrated here this morning and in the past, to do that. So on that basis, I'd rather follow the instinct to get at some small gesture, at least, toward reducing the aggregates in the manner you suggested.\", 'sentences': [{'lemmas': 'just on this latter

Gentlemen, we now have to turn to the decision on the domestic policy directive for the coming months. What I find particularly difficult is the specification for the federal funds rate this coming month. Now, in alternative B, I find myself really wrestling [with a choice between] the federal funds rate specified under alternative B, and a still-smaller range that is 4-1/2 to 5 percent. Now, you know, these ranges have to be realistic. I thought for a time of a range of 4-1/4 to 5-1/4, and I asked myself a question: What would happen to the world we live in if the federal funds rate were to rise from 4-5/8 to 5-1/4? I would say that, for the coming month, it would be an unacceptable increase. So I brought it down to 5, and then I asked myself a question: What about the rate going down to 4-1/4? Well that's possible; 4-1/2 is perhaps better. I could live with one or the other. I think I would like 4-1/2 to 5 a little better.

I think a lot of times you got a month, and the two-month average that we know is coming in pretty high or pretty low. And so it becomes just impossible, unless you just disregard it, to have something in that midpoint. This doesn\\'t happen to be one of those times, although I guess generally [unintelligible], and tremendously so. I would rather have the lower ranges, too, for these two months, because I am concerned about the bulge. And if we could, I would like to save up a little room to accommodate the bulge when it occurs. Now I don\\'t mean by that to make it a very low number, but 3 to 7 on M1, and 7 to 11 on M2 seem to me to be reasonably high numbers. And if could save a half point there, why, we are going to need it, I\\'m quite sure, if there is a [tax] rebate and if it\\'s of the size people have been talking about. And we should, I think, start now to plan our strategies so that we don\\'t seem to [take an action] that people would imagine as a contradiction to the fiscal policy action--the kind of response we got in the spring of \\'75. So I would go for the short-range specs of alternative C. As far as the funds rate is concerned, I can\\'t really disagree with the Chairman--4-1/4 seems low and 5-1/4 seems high. But we are getting awfully myopic on this question of interest rates, and if the aggregates were quite strong, I could imagine us wanting to do this, perhaps as high as 5-1/4; if they were quite weak, I could then imagine us deciding maybe we ought to pull back a little bit--perhaps as low as 4-1/4.

On the M1 and M2, the differences between alternatives A, B, and C are minuscule, and I find that we've sort of become dedicated to a 4 point spread here. I see nothing wrong in this instance to have a 3 to 8 on M1 and a 7 to 12 on M2.

These have been a disturbing element due to their volatility. The agreement provides that the BIS [Bank for International Settlements] will finance the Bank of England to the extent that these balances are reduced, except by bond funding and to the extent that the British reserves simultaneously go down. The details are to be worked out. If the BIS cannot fully carry through that financing, it has a fallback with respect to the participating central banks. Now, the Bank of England is committed to use its best efforts to reduce official sterling balances to working balances. First, by a funding operation offering some of the major holders of official balances 5- to 10- year bonds, 75 percent of which, at a maximum, would be in dollars, the rest in nondollar and nonsterling currencies. Second, whatever is left of the total balances after this operation, [the goal would be] to bring that down to the level of working balances. The detail of that is not described, but it could consist of various administrative measures. Broadly speaking, we're talking about something like PS2 billion sterling, or $3.4 billion [equivalent]; maybe half a billion pounds of that could be funded. Maybe something like PS1 billion might remain as working balances, and the other half billion would have to worked off over time. This is to be done in cooperation with and under the supervision of the Managing Director of the IMF [International Monetary Fund]. The Managing Director of the IMF will confer with the U.K. jointly with the governors of the participating central banks to observe the progress made. Should it turn out that progress is not satisfactory during the two years during which the stand-by agreement is in effect, or if the U.K. should become ineligible to draw under the IMF's stand-by during these two years, then the facility can be suspended. In that case, also, the amounts already drawn will be required to be repaid within 120 days unless the agreement is reconstituted. These are the principle parts of the agreement. Do you want me to go into the Treasury side of this?\", 'owner': <convokit.model.corpus.Corpus object at 0x7fd2cede4e50>, 'id': '19770118_2'})"
